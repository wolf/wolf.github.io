<p>
A generalist with a broad background,
        I am a top-notch software engineer, documenter, architect, implementer, debugger,
        and an excellent resource for the rest of the team.
My wide range of experience allows me to jump into any situation
  and become productive immediately.
I can travel, work on-site or remotely; join or lead a team, or work alone.
I am also an experienced public speaker
  with a love (and a talent) for teaching.
</p>

<div class="detail-view" id="my-why">
<h2 onclick="flip_expand_state('my-why');">My Why</h2>
<p>
I feel purpose most in raising up the people around me by helping them,
        teaching them,
        and by advertising their accomplishments.
I feel purpose in being useful in the situation and getting my job done.
I define success as
        the success of the team around me,
        if I have done my job, been useful, and raised up members of the team.
I value integrity, kindness, honesty, usefulness, and learning (both for me and for others).
I am a life-long learner.
</p>
</div>

<div class="detail-view" id="technical-skills">
<h2 onclick="flip_expand_state('technical-skills');">Technical Skills</h2>
<p>
I am expert in Python having used it since 1998,
        my JavaScript/TypeScript is strong but I have not been focused on it recently,
        and I'm an able programmer in PHP.
Some time ago I was an expert in C++,
        but I could probably still write code in it
        (or almost anything else) given a little preparation and an open book.
I have a great deal of experience with MySQL,
        am reasonably proficient in SQLite,
        have been using PostgreSQL lately,
        and have experience using MongoDB.
I am a full-stack developer,
        well equipped to deal with both the front-end and the back-end.
I have recently been playing with Django and I have some Flask and FastAPI under my belt.
I've done work in Angular and I'm looking forward to working with React.
I am at home on Linux, Mac, or Windows,
        and have been writing cross-platform code since 1991.
I can live happily with the IDE du jour
        or with nothing but the command line.
I have been working with Cloud services,
        mostly AWS.
I wouldn't call myself an expert yet,
        but I'm working on it.
I am an algorithms guy with experience in
        web services, communication, and networking protocols;
        encryption/authentication;
        search;
        compression;
        text systems;
        database engines;
        build system machinery;
        various application frameworks;
        and making things go faster.
</p>
<p>
I have distinguished myself as a public speaker,
  technical evangelist, and educator.
I am a receptive and persuasive communicator,
  both face to face and in lower-bandwidth settings,
  including technical writing and email.
I have extensive experience in
  Open Source and distributed development.

    <span class="company"><a href="https://www.genomenon.com/">Genomenon</a></span>
  </div>
  <p>
At Genomonen I wrote back-end code in Python and a little in Go.
I used Docker extensively; worked with AWS SQS and S3, and LocalStack to simulate them; plus Terraform to manage it all.
Genomenon is a genomic intelligence company which means the core of its offerings are data related and service related.
The data half focused on a complicated pipeline that made scientific papers referencing genes and variants available in Elasticsearch.
We used PostgreSQL along with Elasticsearch and a variety of languages: JavaScript, Go, Python, and Ruby.
  </p>
  <p>
The service half of the business involved human curation of genes and variants.
The dev team also wrote tools to help them do their jobs.

  </div>
  <p>
At LAZ,
    I was a full-stack application developer building literacy tools for K-6 students.
I worked in PHP and JavaScript with deep use of MySQL.
I worked on the mobile team writing back-end code,
    and focusing on our latest writing program.
That means I was almost entirely PHP-focused for that work.
Initially,
    I spent time doing DevOps-related tasks such as
    researching CDNs and implementing our use of one (settling on AWS Cloudfront);
    implementing an additional code staging area (known as postprod);
    researching, setting up, and initially managing an on-prem Git hosting facility (GitLab); and
    converting a large code-base and equally large development team from CVS to Git.
As the team's Git expert,
    I did both regular training on the available tools,
    and one-on-one problem solving with individual developers.
  </p>
  <p>
On the non-coding side,
    I ran our annual intern program: "mentoring the mentors" and handling issues outside the scope of an individual mentor.
I also ran our twice-yearly engineering Hack-a-thon.

  </div>
  <p>
Here, I worked on a new implementation of SourceForge.
This implementation is written in Python atop TurboGears and Pylons.
It uses MongoDB, RabbitMQ, and a great many Python packages.
The client-side functionality is JavaScript relying heavily on jQuery.

  </div>
  <p>
Slashdot is a popular technology news and discussion site.
My job there was to implement modern web UI
        using client-side browser facilities including JavaScript, AJAX, CSS, and the DOM
        as well as server-side tools including Perl, the Template Toolkit, MySQL, Apache, and others.
I've implemented web features such as
    dynamic loading of stories,
        drag-and-drop arrangement for Slashboxes,
        a dual-thumb slider for setting comment viewing thresholds,
        dynamic nod/nix menus,
        auto-completing text entry,

Trolltech (now The Qt Company) is the maker of Qt.
As Evangelist, my primary role was to be a public speaker and educator.
I have spoken at open conferences, including
  FISL, LinuxWorld, SIGGRAPH, LinuxLunacy, OSDW, Microsoft PDC, ADHOC, Gnomedex, and others.
I have also spoken at internal conferences for customer companies,
  including Synopsys, and Roxar.
I was on the road as much or more than I was at home.
I wrote software built on Qt so that I could understand the problems Qt users face;
  and continually encouraged the team to support the complete set of C++ features
  and facilities, including compatibility with the C++ Standard Library and Boost.
I interacted directly with the engineering team, with customers, and with Open Source users.
I served on external standards committees to represent Trolltech's interests,
  getting the Linux Standard Base to accept Qt as an industry standard.

  <p>
Ann Arbor Digital Arts (A2DA) is, principally, a software research and development firm
  which also provides contract engineering, consulting, and IT support.
At A2DA I designed and built the web-based UI for a Department of Education Phase I
  pilot program bringing to educators and school personnel
   usable survey results of the substance abuse patterns and practice of their students.

  </div>
  <p>
In joining mozilla.org staff,
  in addition to my Netscape engineering tasks,
  I also took on the tasks of driver, super-reviewer, and technical evangelist.
In these roles, particularly the latter two,
  I became responsible for educating engineers and potential engineers:
  teaching them the underlying architecture of Mozilla,
  from the big picture all the way down to
  rules and techniques to improve their code at the lowest levels.
As a technical evangelist,
  I bring engineering expertise to companies and groups interested in exploiting the Mozilla code-base.
I bring them up to speed on the code and on interacting with the community
  to reach their goals.
As a key player in our Mozilla University effort,
  I have traveled to universities across the country
  giving technical lectures to CS students and faculty
  to bring new and bright engineering talent into the Mozilla project,
  as well as exporting Mozilla's UI building machinery
  to academia as a framework for use in their own research.
My role with mozilla.org continued even beyond my association with Netscape.

  <p>
I designed and implemented the bulk of
  Mozilla's XPCOM type-safe and leak resistant object management facilities
  (note, however, that there is a great deal more to XPCOM than just that machinery).
I designed and implemented Mozilla's string library
  which far surpassed its predecessor in efficiency and flexibility.
I served terms as module owner of both XPCOM and Strings;
  and I was a key resource for other module owners
  in their architectural work.
I was the original
  architect of the XPToolkit team,
        which produced XUL, our cross-platform, XML-based, user-interface description language,
        and related services.
I was also the architect for several key tools including
        MacCVS Pro
        and the Macintosh (classic) build system.

  <p>
In 1998, as part of bringing the Netscape browser to Open Source,
    I first encountered and began using Python.
It has been a favorite ever since.

  <p>
I was
        one of the principal implementers of FullWrite Professional 1.0
        (a full-featured WYSIWYG word processor for the Macintosh) at Ann Arbor,
        and leader of the tools group for the Mac division at Ashton-Tate after the acquisition.
I contributed to the UI design, and much of its implementation;
        designed and implemented the menu manager
                and a smart (MVC) dialog manager.
